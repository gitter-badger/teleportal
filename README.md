# WebXR for Learning

"WebXR for Learning" is a working title for a project idea for Mozilla's Global Sprint, May 10-11, 2018. Hopefully during the Sprint we can turn this idea into a prototype!

## The Idea

The idea is to create a free, open repository of Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality content, aimed at educators and students. It would contain 3D assets, categorised/tagged to make them easy to find by topic/curriculum. Teachers and students could then use it to quickly find suitable content for lessons, study or revision.

## Technology Background

Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR) are on the rise. Virtual Reality is now quite accessible with cheap cardboard-based headsets. Impressive Augmented Reality experiences are now becoming possible with just a mobile phone (for example, making use of ARKit on iOS and ARCore on Android). And both VR and AR are now possible with open web technologies, such as the up-and-coming [WebXR standard](https://github.com/immersive-web/webxr) ("XR" incorporates both Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality, basically meaning "Whichever Kind You Want" Reality!).

Mozilla have a WebXR library called [Three.xr.js](https://github.com/mozilla/three.xr.js/) (based on the popular [Three.js](https://threejs.org/)), plus [aframe-xr](https://github.com/mozilla/aframe-xr) (based on [A-Frame](https://aframe.io/)) which makes it possible to develop AR and VR content on the web by writing HTML! 

I am anticipating that we use [aframe-xr](https://github.com/mozilla/aframe-xr) for the AR/VR part of the prototype (but I'm open to other suggestions too!)

## To Do List

This will grow and evolve, but as a starting point!

 * Ideate about how the site would work for end-users (e.g. user journey)
 * Ideate about how the site would work for content creators (e.g. upload, moderation?)
 * Initial wireframes and/or website design
 * Create and/or find suitable, free, 3D content to incorporate
 * Develop a prototype website with a few sample assets
 * Make it possible to view the assets in Augmented Reality
 * (If time), make it possible to view the assets in Virtual Reality too

## What Kind of Help Would Be Useful?

Any of the following kinds of skills/experience would be especially useful:

* Education
* Web design
* Web development (HTML / CSS / JavaScript)
* Product management
* Augmented Reality / Virtual Reality
* 3D modelling/animation

This is not an exclusive list - any assistance would be welcome!

## (Expected to be) Frequently Asked Questions

### What about [Sketchfab](https://sketchfab.com/), [Google Poly](https://poly.google.com/) etc.?

[SketchFab](https://sketchfab.com/) and [Poly](https://poly.google.com) a great collections of user-submitted 3D content! However, they are not aimed at education; they are general 3D repositories and the content may not be suitable/relevant for educational use.

Also, SketchFab is a commercial platform and the idea for this project is to try creating something free and open. Imagine something a bit more like "Wikimedia for XR"!

It may be that we could incorporate or link to some of this existing content from this new prototype though, depending on the licences? That's something we could check!
